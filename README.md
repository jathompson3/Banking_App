# Banking_App
Java banking applicaion
My project proposal's overall objective is to create a personal banking application. Users will have the ability to deposit and withdraw money from their accounts. Users will have the option to check their balances as well. This program's first step is allowing users to create an account and deposit an initial balance. Fields will include their name, age, hometown, and balance. 

There will be two classes: Accounts and Checkings. There will also be a function to transfer money from one account to another.
